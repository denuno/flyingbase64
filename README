Simple POC for maybe grabbing the request and piping it through
a base64 decoder.

Uses fileupload for streaming:
http://commons.apache.org/fileupload/streaming.html

And codec for decoding:
http://commons.apache.org/codec/

Theoretically, doing this prevents several copies of the same
data in memory.  At the least, it is an interesting avenue.

Install by putting the grab64 folder in the webroot.
